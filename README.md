### KNOWN BUGS

* ~~Refreshing the page on a user's profile causes the site to crash.~~
 * ~~Cause: Server can't fetch user profile before the site renders(?)~~
 * ~~Solution: Display a loading screen until all the necessary state's are set.(Assuming the problem is caused by the mentioned problem above.)~~
**FIXED** 

* Liking a post works as intended, however disliking a post will dislike another, random post.
 * Cause: The pointer to the correct post is distributed wrongly.(?)
 * Solution: =Nothing so far, will take a second look at the code later.*
